### Desktop Notifications

**What are Desktop Notifications?**
Desktop notifications appear even when:

### Notification Timing

**Notify before due time (minutes)**

- Example: "5" means alert 5 minutes before deadline
- Set to "0" for alerts at exact due time

**How it works:**
If a task is due at 10:30 AM and you set 5 minutes:
- You'll get notified at 10:25 AM
- Gives you time to prepare!
